This was project done by both [Jang Suh](https://github.com/JHPBri) and [myself](https://github.com/Lupey1103) to graduate from [4Geeks Academy](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy).
This website will be for those like Jang and myself who have trouble planning dates or having trouble finding things to do on vacation.

While Jang did most of the front end I did the backend code to help finish as much of the website as we could. I hope to completely finish this project so we could release it to the public to use.
